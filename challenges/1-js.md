You can find the section we want you to build below and the already built page here to help. [View Web Page](https://chefsharptriad.com/)

__Please note__: The live version of this section can not simply be copy and pasted. The current site does not use Bootstrap 5 and is currently using a page builder. This link to the live site is simply to help you determine how to style the page

1. Clone this repo
2. Check out a new branch named your-name-js-1
3. Build the following section using Bootstrap 5, HTML, & CSS
4. All Js can be placed in __assets/js/main.js__

## Requirements
1. Please use [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp) arrow functions and syntax when writing your javascript
2. Make sure to use functions. Keeping our JS in functions makes it more module than injecting right on the page.
3. Please use [jsonplaceholderapi.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
4. Use Bootstrap 5 for components needed

## Objective
1. use [jsonplaceholderapi.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to fetch data and map data to display individual posts. Use the posts endpoint below<br/> 
`fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => console.log(json));`<br/><br/>

2. Output that data in a bootstrap row that contains [card components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/).
