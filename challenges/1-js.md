## Code Challenge Javascript Task

1. Clone this repo
2. Check out a new branch named your-name-js-1
3. Build the following section using Bootstrap 5, HTML, & CSS
4. All Js can be placed in __assets/js/main.js__

## Requirements
1. Please use [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp) arrow functions and syntax when writing your javascript
2. Make sure to use functions. Keeping our JS in functions makes it more module than injecting right on the page.
3. Please use [jsonplaceholderapi.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
4. Use Bootstrap 5 for components needed

## Objective
1. use [jsonplaceholderapi.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to fetch data and map data to display individual posts. Use the posts endpoint below<br/> 
`fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => console.log(json));`<br/><br/>

2. Output that data in a bootstrap row that contains [card components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/).
#### Content Needed
- Title
- Body
- ID

## Ask for Help!
We encourage you to reach out for help. We are happy to point you in the right direction if you get stuck.

## What you shouldn't ask help on?
